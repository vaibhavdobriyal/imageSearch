<b>Environment Setup - MAC OSX Python PyCharm</b>

Configuring PyCharm to use Python and OpenCV on  MACOSX

The process requires creation of virtual environment - since there are multiple versions of Python installed on OSX. We recommend using brew to install python and not use the system one. Please donâ€™t break the system one else the osx will run into issues.
							
$ brew doctor	
Follow any troubleshooting advice it gives.	 							Now, update Homebrew:							
$ brew update
Run the following command to install Python 2.7:					
$ brew install python
			
Now, we can install NumPy. Homebrew's selection of Python library packages is limited so we use a separate package management tool called pip, which comes with Homebrew's Python:
 $ pip install numpy
	
SciPy contains some Fortran code, so we need an appropriate compiler. We can use Homebrew to install the gfortran compiler:							
$ brew install gfortran									
$ pip install scipy
To install OpenCV on a 64-bit system (all new Mac hardware since late 2006), run:
 $ brew install opencv

Download Jet Brains PyCharm and set it up.

Create a project and then go to preferences for project and set up Virtual environment say python_devenv - point the python to /usr/bin/Cellar/ and where your python is. 

Next task is to create the syslinks for opencv. Go to the directory where homebrew installed opencv (/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.12_2/lib/python2.7/site-packages) and create following links

$ln -s cv.py ~/python_devenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv.py
$ ln -s cv2.so ~/python_devenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so

You are good to go.
